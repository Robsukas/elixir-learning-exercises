# Shell

**In this directory I am mainly working with the book Elixir in Action and posting my journey of that. In order to reduce noise and avoid confusion, I only have a single directory called shell where I work and test out the topics mentioned in the book. Usually the directory only contains the latest topic that I worked on, so if needed, go through the commit history, where I have annotated all the previous topics on the commit messages starting with "STUDY:". Feel free to contact me on Slack if you have any questions, tips or insights for me, as my top priority is to learn all of the needed tech stack efficiently.**
