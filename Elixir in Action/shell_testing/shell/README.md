# Shell

**In this directory I am mainly working with the book Elixir in Action and posting my journey of that. In order to reduce noise and avoid confusion, I only have a single directory called shell where I work and test out the topics mentioned in the book.** 
**Usually the directory only contains the latest topic that I worked on, so if needed, go through the commit history, where I have annotated all the previous topics on the commit messages starting with "STUDY:".**
